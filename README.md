# Bath Safe Routes Map - Got Ya Back

The Bath Safe Routes map is being developed to provide safe routes for people in Bath to get home. Users can access the map and select where they are heading to; an area of Bath, a student accommodation building, campus or just to get a taxi.
The map provides guidelines with points of interest along the way home. Eventually as a user becomes more familiar with their own safe way to get home, they won't need the map anymore.
